# FlexiFed

This repository built the simulation code for the paper "FlexiFed: Personalized Federated Learning for Edge Clients with Heterogeneous Model Architectures". The code implements a 40-client VGG training on the CIFAR10 dataset with i.i.d patterns. The code has been tested and validated on the Apple Silicon M4 Pro platform.
